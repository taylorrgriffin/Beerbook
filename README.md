# Beerbook

Beerbook is a site for finding information about all of your favorite beers and hops. It is written using React, and relies on the <a href="https://www.brewerydb.com/">BreweryDB API</a> for data.


This project is a collaberation between myself (<a href="https://github.com/taylorrgriffin">taylorrgriffin</a>) and Ethan Ahuja (<a href="https://github.com/ahujae">ahujae</a>), and was our final project for the Advanced Web Development course at Oregon State University. 

## Setup:

Prior to running this app, you must obtain an API key from BreweryDB by signing up for the service<a href="https://www.brewerydb.com/signup">here</a> (it's free!).<br/>
After signing up, input your unique API key into the apiKey field of the json file located at `src/secrets.json`.<br/>
Once you do that you are good to go! Execute the commands below and you'll have your very own local instance of Beerbook.<br/>

## Usage:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).<br/>
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs dependencies locally (required prior to running app).

### `npm start`
